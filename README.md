A smart solar panel system that tracks the light vertically is a system that uses a mechanism to physically move the solar panels in order to optimize their alignment with the sun throughout the day. This allows the panels to capture more sunlight and produce more electricity. The tracking mechanism is an axis tracking system, which tracks the sun vertically.
The smart monitoring system in this kind of solar panel system is connected to a light sensor or a sunlight sensor, which is used to measure the amount of sunlight falling on the panels. The system then uses that information to adjust the orientation of the panels in order to maximize the amount of sunlight that is captured. This results in increased energy production and efficiency compared to fixed solar panel systems.
The vertical tracking mechanism is specially designed to rotate the solar panel system along the vertical axis and follow the sun's movement across the sky. This ensures that the panels are always positioned at the optimal angle to capture maximum sunlight and generate electricity throughout the day.
